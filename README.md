## 🎨 Design Details

The dashboard uses a modern color scheme inspired by the NFL:
- **Primary Color**: NFL Blue (#013369)
- **Secondary Color**: NFL Red (#D50A0A)
- **Accent Color**: Gold (#FFB612)

The design is fully responsive with breakpoints for:
- Desktop (1200px+)
- Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile (<768px)

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility with ARIA labels
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS variables, flexbox, grid, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks
  - Dynamic content loading and DOM manipulation
  - localStorage caching with expiration
  - Real-time search and filtering
  - Sortable tables
  - Keyboard event handling
- **ESPN Public API**: Live NFL statistics data
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for static websites
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated weekly data updates (active)

## 🔄 Automated Data Updates

The dashboard features **automated weekly data updates** powered by GitHub Actions:

### How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/update-data.yml`)
   - Runs every **Tuesday at 6 AM EST** to capture all weekly NFL games (Thursday-Monday)
   - Can be manually triggered from the Actions tab
   - Automatically commits and pushes updated data files

2. **Data Fetching Script** (`scripts/fetch-data.js`)
   - Node.js script that fetches data from ESPN's public API
   - Retrieves schedule, standings, team stats, and player leaders
   - Saves data as JSON files in the `data/` directory

3. **Live Data** (Browser)
   - Dashboard pages fetch data directly from ESPN API when loaded
   - 5-minute localStorage caching for optimal performance
   - Automatic error handling and fallbacks

### Manual Updates

To manually fetch updated data:

```bash
# Run the fetch script locally
node scripts/fetch-data.js

# Or trigger the GitHub Action
# Go to Actions tab → "Update NFL Stats Data" → "Run workflow"
```

### Data Sources

- **Primary**: ESPN Public API (live data)
- **Backup**: JSON files in `data/` directory (weekly snapshots)
- **Cache**: localStorage (5-minute expiration)

   - Free tier provides 500 requests/month (adequate for weekly updates)

2. **Configure GitHub Secret**
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Create secret named `ODDS_API_KEY` with your API key
   - See [GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md](GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

3. **Data Updates**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically fetch odds weekly
   - Odds are saved to `data/odds.json`
   - Schedule page reads from static file (no API key exposure)

**Important**: Betting odds are for informational purposes only. Must be 21+ to bet. Not available in all jurisdictions. Please gamble responsibly.
